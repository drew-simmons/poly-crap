"""poly-crap: scan any repository, or develop poly-crap itself.

Works in two modes, chosen automatically from the repository you are standing
in. Nothing is derived from where this file lives, so the skill behaves the
same installed per-project or globally.

  scan mode (any repository)
    check         report the binary, the detected stack, and coverage reports
    install       install the poly-crap binary (network; asks first)
    scan          run the scan, optionally gated
    baseline      write a baseline JSON to compare later runs against
    self-install  copy this skill into your global skills directory

  dev mode (only inside a poly-crap source checkout)
    build         cargo build --locked
    fixture       build the six-language fixture repo
    smoke         build, then run every scenario and assert the results
    dev-run       run the freshly built binary against the fixture

Only the standard library is used. Schema checks shell out to
`uvx check-jsonschema` and are skipped when uvx is missing.
